i want to build one system in which user will enter his business requiremnets, services he offer targetted audience for lead generation and it will automatically decide platforms based on the smart keywords that will get results like emails, profile links, contact details etc, then save those reults along with the pitch we should do while approaching 
now i wanna ask if we should deepscrape those results on google which come after google ??? or this apptrach is fine..  suggest me the best approach to get best context of into too so that we not only get contact details but also the contxt too so that we can approach them, but when we are deep scraping those google reuslts the problem is we can't process that huge data with llm so what can i do






It sounds like you're building an advanced system for lead generation, and you're right to be cautious about handling large amounts of data. Deep scraping Google results for contacts could result in a lot of data, which may be difficult to manage using LLMs due to limitations in processing large-scale information.

Here’s a possible approach that could address both the need for quality data and efficient processing:

1. Smart Scraping with Contextual Focus:
Instead of scraping all Google results, you could refine the scraping process to target specific types of content that align with the user’s business requirements and services. For instance, scrape pages like LinkedIn profiles, company websites, or relevant industry forums where contact details are typically available with rich contextual data.

You could use a combination of:

Smart Keywords: As you mentioned, use smart keywords to decide which platforms and sources to scrape based on user input.

Context Filters: Implement context filters like industry type, job titles, or keywords related to services offered to ensure you're pulling more relevant data, not just raw contact info.

2. Data Aggregation with Context:
Once data is scraped, aggregate it into structured formats (e.g., CSV, database). Store contact details (emails, profile links) alongside key contextual information (like job title, company name, sector, recent posts, etc.).

This allows the system to not only store contact data but also to maintain the context necessary for crafting personalized outreach messages.

3. Batch Processing with LLMs:
For handling large amounts of data without overwhelming the LLM, you could:

Process in Batches: Instead of running everything through the LLM at once, break the data into smaller chunks and process them sequentially. This allows you to focus on the most relevant or highest-priority leads first.

Pre-process Data: Before passing data to the LLM, pre-process it by extracting the most relevant details (e.g., job title, industry, company name) into simpler structures for the model to work with.

4. Efficient Data Handling:
Use Vector Databases for storing and indexing the data based on its relevance. This makes it easier to retrieve specific lead information quickly when needed without re-scraping or re-processing.

Cloud-based Processing: You could leverage cloud services that allow for scalable computing to process large amounts of data in parallel, ensuring that your LLM has access to only a manageable subset at a time.

5. Combining Automated Outreach and AI-driven Personalization:
Once the contact details are gathered and enriched with context, you could use your system to automatically craft personalized outreach pitches based on the data. For example, if the contact works in marketing for a tech startup, the system can tailor the pitch based on common industry pain points, recent trends, or the service offering.

Alternative Approach (If Google Scraping is Not Feasible):
Use Social Media APIs: For platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, or even Reddit, official APIs could provide more structured access to user data with context. This avoids the need for deep scraping while still allowing for detailed insights.

Third-Party Data Providers: Consider integrating third-party lead generation services or databases like ZoomInfo, Hunter.io, or Clearbit that specialize in providing enriched contact information and context without scraping.

By combining these methods, you'll be able to gather the best of both worlds: high-quality leads with the context necessary for personalization, while avoiding the issues that come with processing large-scale scraped data directly.
